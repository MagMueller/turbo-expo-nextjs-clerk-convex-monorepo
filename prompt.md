Description of Features

one starts with 100 budget. This can be distributed over tasks. Minimum 0. then new tasks don't get more. If a task is done I get the budget back, if it is successful it gets also added to the score. 

if unsuccessful, I get nothing back.

Task item should have a green check which marks successful and a red cross for not successful.
if I added a verifier when I click completed its pending until he approves in his verifier tab. then I get the points. if he says not passed, he gets 50% and the other 50% disappear so the platform gets them. 

 
i can set deadlines.

i can sort tasks by budget deadline created at.

on my goal screen I have organized screen with very easy option to create tasks just by typing.

and when scrolling down I can see my finished for.

in my unfinished work I can change attributes like deadline, name, verifier.

with arrow keys I can navigate between todos.

when creating goals there should be additionally to enter a button to send new goal. deadline and verifier should show up after selecting.

make buttons in goal list view a bit bigger and spread out and display below them e.g. deadline budget and verifier.
